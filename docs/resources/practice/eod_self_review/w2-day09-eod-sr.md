Today, we have covered a lot of new ground, and we have introduced a lot of new concepts.  
We will be building on these in future sessions, so it is important that you are comfortable with them. Try the following **pen-and-paper exercises** as a way of checking that you are becoming used to the terminology that we have introduced in this chapter. Donâ€™t be put off by the fact that we suggest that you do these on paper rather than within BlueJ.  
_It will be good practice to try things out without a compiler._

1. Correct the error in this method:

   ```java
   public void getAge()
   {
      return age;
   }
   ```

2. Correct the error in this method:

   ```java
   public int setAge(int newAge)
   {
      age = newAge;
   }
   ```

3. Write an accessor method called `getName` that returns the value of a field called `name`, whose type is `String`.

4. Write a mutator method called `setAge` that takes a single parameter of type `int` and sets the value of a field called `age`.
