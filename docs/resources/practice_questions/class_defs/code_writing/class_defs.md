### Easy Level Code Writing Questions
1. Implement a simple `Counter` class in Java. This class will help in counting the number of clicks. Your task is to create a class with the following specifications:  
   - A private integer variable to store the current count value.
   - A method named `click` that advances the count value by `1` each time it is called.
   - A method named `getValue` that returns the current count value.
   - A method named `reset` that sets the count value back to `0`.

   Implement the `Counter` class based on the above specifications.
