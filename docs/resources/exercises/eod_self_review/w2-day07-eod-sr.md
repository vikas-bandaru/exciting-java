# Module 1: Java Foundations
## Day 5: Introduction to Java through BlueJ
### Self Review
---
Today, we have covered a lot of new ground, and we have introduced a lot of new concepts.  
We will be building on these in future sessions, so it is important that you are comfortable with them. Try the following **pencil-and-paper exercises** as a way of checking that you are becoming used to the terminology that we have introduced today. Donâ€™t be put off by the fact that we suggest that you do these on paper rather than within BlueJ.  
_It will be good practice to try things out without a compiler._

1. What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one field called name, to a circle object?
2. Write the header for a method named `send` that has one parameter of type `String`, and does not return a value.
3. Write the header for a method named `average` that has two parameters, both of type `int`, and returns an `int` value.
