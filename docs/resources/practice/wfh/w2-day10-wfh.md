## Work from Home
### Reading and Learning Exercises using ChatGPT

1. Learn more about Compound Interest, power of x and y, hypotenuse of a right angle triangle, and distance between two 2D geometry points. Learn what they are, when to use them, which real world applications use them, what are the formula, examples to understand how to calculate each of them.  
   **How to check if you understood it well:** Ask ChatGPT to give you questions to check your knowledge on this. Try to answer those questions. If you get at least 70% of the questions right, then you can say you understood the concepts.  
   **Note:** Check Day 2 in Google Classroom for ChatGPT material.

### Practice Methods More with Math methods

Let's try writing the insides of some of these methods:

1. *Method:* `calculatePower`  
   *Details:* Create a method named `calculatePower` that takes two integers representing the base and exponent as parameters and returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.
2. *Method:* `calculateCompoundInterest`  
   *Details:* Implement a method called `calculateCompoundInterest` that takes three doubles representing the principal amount, rate of interest (in percentage), and time (in years) as parameters and returns the compound interest earned.
3. *Method:* `calculateHypotenuse`  
   *Details:* Implement a method called `calculateHypotenuse` that takes two doubles representing the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle as parameters and returns the length of the hypotenuse.
4. *Method:* `calculateDistance`  
   *Details:* Create a method named `calculateDistance` that takes four integers representing the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of two points in a 2D plane as parameters and returns the distance between the two points.
5. *Method:* `calculateFactorial`  
   *Details:* Write a method named `calculateFactorial` that takes an integer as a parameter and returns the factorial of that number.  
   *Note:* Assume the integer parameter value is in between 1 and 10 only.
