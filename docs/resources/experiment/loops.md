## Basic Experiments (What Could Go Wrong)

### **Experiment 1: Infinite Loop with `while` Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, but forget to increment the loop variable.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);  // Missing increment i++
}
```

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- This loop will run infinitely because `i` is never incremented and will always be `1`.

**Solution**:
- Always ensure you update the loop variable inside the loop body.
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // Incrementing i
}
```

### **Experiment 2: Off-by-One Error in `for` Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10 but accidentally start the loop at 0.

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- The loop will print numbers from 0 to 10 instead of 1 to 10 because it starts at 0.

**Solution**:
- Make sure the initialization is correct and starts from 1.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

### **Experiment 3: Using `break` Incorrectly in a Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a loop that should continue until it finds a specific number in an array, but accidentally place the `break` statement outside the `if` condition.

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == 30) {
        System.out.println("Found at index: " + i);
    }
    break;  // This will exit the loop after the first iteration
}
```

**What Could Go Wrong**:
- The loop will break after the first iteration regardless of whether the target is found.

**Solution**:
- Place the `break` statement inside the `if` block to ensure it only exits when the target is found.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == 30) {
        System.out.println("Found at index: " + i);
        break;  // Only break when the target is found
    }
}
```

## Tricky Experiments

Here are several experiments designed to focus on nuances related to loops, including the use of single-line versus multiple-line statements, common mistakes with semicolons, and variations of loops. These exercises help beginners spot common logical and syntactical mistakes while mastering the proper use of loops.

### **Experiment 1: Single-Line vs. Multiple-Line Statements Inside a Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

- **Single-Line Statement**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    System.out.println(i);  // Only one statement inside the loop
```
- **Multiple-Line Statement**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);   // Multiple statements inside the loop
    System.out.println("Looping...");
}
```

**What to Observe**:
- In the single-line version, the lack of braces means only the first line after the loop runs as part of the loop.
- In the multiple-line version, braces ensure that multiple lines are treated as part of the loop body.

---

### **Experiment 2: Semicolon at the End of the `while` Condition**

**Scenario**: Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, but accidentally put a semicolon at the end of the `while` condition.

- **Incorrect Version (With Semicolon)**:
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5);  // This semicolon causes the loop to do nothing
{
    System.out.println(i);  // This runs only once, after the loop ends
    i++;
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The semicolon makes the `while` loop an empty loop, and the block inside the braces runs only once after the loop.

- **Correct Version**:
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

**What to Observe**:
- Removing the semicolon ensures the code inside the braces runs as part of the loop.

---

### **Experiment 3: Semicolon at the End of the `for` Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5, but accidentally put a semicolon at the end of the `for` condition.

- **Incorrect Version (With Semicolon)**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++);  // This semicolon makes the loop do nothing
{
    System.out.println(i);  // This causes an error because `i` is out of scope
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The semicolon makes the `for` loop an empty loop. The loop runs, but nothing happens inside it.

- **Correct Version**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**What to Observe**:
- Removing the semicolon ensures that the loop body executes.

---

### **Experiment 4: Infinite Loop with a `while` Loop**

**Scenario**: Write a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5, but forget to increment the loop variable.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);  // i is never incremented, so this will loop infinitely
}
```

**What Happens**:
- This creates an infinite loop because `i` is never incremented, so the condition `i <= 5` is always true.

**Solution**:
- Add the increment statement inside the loop.
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // Increment i to avoid infinite loop
}
```

---

### **Experiment 5: Missing Braces in Loops with Multiple Statements**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop that prints numbers and a custom message, but omit the braces around multiple statements.

- **Incorrect Version (Missing Braces)**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    System.out.println(i);  // Only this line is inside the loop
    System.out.println("Looping...");  // This line is outside the loop
```

**What Happens**:
- The second `System.out.println()` statement runs after the loop finishes, not during each iteration.

- **Correct Version (With Braces)**:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
    System.out.println("Looping...");
}
```

**What to Observe**:
- Using braces groups the multiple statements together inside the loop.

---

### **Experiment 6: Nested Loops**

**Scenario**: Write a nested `for` loop to print a simple pattern of numbers.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
        System.out.print(j + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();  // Move to the next line
}
```

---

**What Happens**:
- The outer loop controls the number of lines, and the inner loop prints numbers on each line.

**Variation**: Try changing the ranges or swapping `i` and `j` to explore different patterns.

---

## Variations of the `for` Loop

### **1. `for` Loop with Multiple Variables**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop that uses two variables, one incrementing and one decrementing.

```java
for (int i = 1, j = 10; i <= 5; i++, j--) {
    System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The loop increments `i` and decrements `j` simultaneously in each iteration.

---

### **2. `for` Loop Without Initialization**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop where the initialization of the loop variable happens outside the loop.

```java
int i = 1;
for (; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The loop works without initialization inside the `for` loop header, showing that the initialization step is optional.

---

### **3. `for` Loop Without Condition**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop that uses a `break` statement to terminate instead of a condition in the loop header.

```java
for (int i = 1;; i++) {  // No condition in the loop header
    if (i > 5) {
        break;  // Terminate the loop when i > 5
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The loop doesnâ€™t have a condition, but it terminates with a `break` when `i > 5`.

---

### **4. `for` Loop Without Update**

**Scenario**: Write a `for` loop where the update step happens inside the loop body instead of in the loop header.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5;) {  // No update in the loop header
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // Update i inside the loop body
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The loop works without an update step in the loop header, showing that the update step is optional.

---

## Logical Mistakes in Loop Conditions

### **Mistake 1: Off-By-One Error in Loop Condition**

**Scenario**: Write a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5, but mistakenly use `i < 5` instead of `i <= 5`.

```java
for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);  // Will print 1 to 4, not 1 to 5
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The loop prints numbers from 1 to 4 because the condition `i < 5` excludes 5.

**Solution**:
- Use `i <= 5` to include 5 in the loop.
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);  // Will print 1 to 5
}
```

---

### **Mistake 2: Using Post-Increment Instead of Pre-Increment**

**Scenario**: Write a loop to increment `i` after printing, but mistakenly use `i++` in the condition.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i++ <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);  // Prints values from 2 to 6, not 1 to 5
}
```

**What Happens**:
- The post-increment `i++` increments `i` after the condition is evaluated, so it prints 2 to 6 instead of 1 to 5.

**Solution**:
- Use pre-increment in the condition or update `i` separately.
```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

---
