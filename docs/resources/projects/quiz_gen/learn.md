# Technology-Wise Main Concepts to Focus On (Objects-First Approach)
## Java

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals:**

   - **Classes and Objects:** Understanding the basics of classes and objects, defining classes, creating objects, and accessing object members.
   - **Methods:** Defining and using methods, method parameters, and return values.
   - **Constructors:** Understanding constructors and their use in object creation.

2. **Basic OOP Principles:**

   - **Encapsulation:** Using private fields and public methods to control access to data.
   - **Inheritance:** Extending classes, understanding superclass-subclass relationships, and using the super keyword.
   - **Polymorphism:** Method overriding, dynamic method dispatch, and interfaces (basic understanding).

3. **Advanced OOP Concepts:**

   - **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Abstract methods and classes, implementing interfaces, and understanding the role of interfaces in polymorphism.
   - **Inner Classes (Optional):** Understanding nested and inner classes, their usage and benefits.
   - **Collections Framework:** Utilizing classes like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap to store collections of objects.

4. **File Handling:**

   - **Reading from Files:** Using FileReader, BufferedReader, and Scanner to read data from files.
   - **Writing to Files:** Using FileWriter and BufferedWriter to write data to files.
   - **Exception Handling:** Managing exceptions using try-catch blocks, especially for I/O operations.

## HTML, CSS, and JS:

1. **HTML:**

   - **Basic Tags and Attributes:** html, head, body, div, span, p, h1-h6.
   - **Form Elements:** input, textarea, select, button.
   - **Table Elements:** table, tr, td, th.

2. **CSS:**

   - **Basic Syntax:** Selectors, properties, values.
   - **Styling Text:** Fonts, colors, text alignment.
   - **Box Model:** Margins, padding, borders.
   - **Layout:** Display properties, positioning, flexbox basics.

3. **JavaScript Basics:**

   - **Syntax and Data Types:** Understanding the basics of JavaScript.
   - **Functions and Scope:** Defining and using functions, understanding scope.
   - **Events and DOM Manipulation:** Handling events and manipulating the DOM.

## Java Servlets:

1. **Basics of Web Applications:** Understanding HTTP protocol, client-server architecture, and the role of servlets.
2. **Servlet Lifecycle:** init(), service(), and destroy() methods.
3. **Handling Requests and Responses:** Using doGet and doPost methods, reading request parameters, and generating responses.
4. **Session Management:** Managing user sessions using cookies and HttpSession.

## Springboot (future):

1. **Basics of Spring Framework:**

   - **Dependency Injection:** Understanding and using dependency injection.
   - **Spring Boot Setup and Configuration:** Setting up and configuring a Spring Boot application.

2. **Spring MVC:**

   - **Controllers and Request Mapping:** Creating controllers and mapping requests to handlers.
   - **Model and View:** Understanding the model-view-controller architecture.

3. **Data Handling:**

   - **Spring Data JPA:** Using Spring Data JPA to interact with databases.
   - **Connecting to Databases:** Setting up and managing database connections.

## Angular (future):

1. **Basics:**

   - **TypeScript Overview:** Understanding the basics of TypeScript.
   - **Angular CLI and Project Setup:** Using Angular CLI to set up and manage projects.

2. **Components and Templates:**

   - **Creating Components:** Defining and using Angular components.
   - **Template Syntax:** Understanding and using Angular template syntax.

3. **Services and Dependency Injection:**

   - **Creating and Injecting Services:** Defining and using services in Angular.
   - **HTTP Client for API Calls:** Making HTTP requests using Angular's HTTP client.

## Project Build Steps (Objects-First Approach):

1. **Initial Setup:**

   - Setting up Java development environment.
   - Creating basic project structure with classes and objects.

2. **File Handling and Quiz Generation:**

   - Implementing file reading and parsing using object-oriented principles.
   - Generating quiz content using Java objects and methods.

3. **HTML and CSS:**

   - Creating simple web pages to display quizzes.
   - Using basic CSS for styling.

4. **JavaScript:**

   - Adding interactivity to the web pages.
   - Handling events and DOM manipulation for dynamic behavior.

5. **Servlet Integration:**

   - Creating servlets to handle file uploads and quiz generation.
   - Integrating servlets with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

6. **Future Enhancements:**

   - Migrating backend to Springboot.
   - Developing frontend with Angular.

This objects-first approach focuses on understanding and utilizing object-oriented principles from the beginning, gradually introducing more complex concepts and technologies as students build the Quiz Generator App.
