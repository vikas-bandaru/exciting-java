## What is an Object?
> An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects:

Real-world objects share two characteristics:  
a) State  
b) Behavior  

Dogs have state:  
name, color, breed, hungry  
and behavior:  
barking, fetching, wagging tail  

Bicycles also have state:  
current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed  
and behavior:  
changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes  

Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
