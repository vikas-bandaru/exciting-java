## Download _objects-practice_ projects

1. [days](../../project_zips/bluej/part01/days.zip)
2. [rectangles](../../project_zips/bluej/part01/rectangles.zip)
3. [pictures](../../project_zips/bluej/part01/pictures.zip)

## Experiments on _objects-practice_ project

1. Download and extract _days_ project in your **bluej_projects** folder. Open in BlueJ. There are two options to create instances. Explore all available methods.
2. Which option of `Day` class creates a `Day` instance with today's date, month, and year?
3. Can you create a `Day` instance of any given year, month, and date? Try giving values like `99` for `aDayOfMonth` or `aMonth` or `aYear`. Does it accept?
4. Find a way to calculate age of a person using `Day` object's methods.
5. Can the same process be used to find how long a person lived?
6. Try checking the new `Day` value using `String toString()` method after adding some number of days. Verify if it is correct by referring to the calendar.
7. Download and extract _rectangles_ project in your **bluej_projects** folder. Open in BlueJ. Create an instance of `Rectangle` and draw it. What do you observe? Is the `draw()` method of `Rectangle` in this project different from the `draw()` method of `Rectangle` in _figures_ project? 
8. Create an instance of `Rectangle` using `new Rectangle()` and create another `Rectangle` instance using `new Rectangle(double x, double y, double width, double height)`. What do you observe when you try drawing both of these rectangles? What do you observe? What do you think is the reason behind the result?
9. How is `setColor()` method of the `Rectangle` class in this project different from that of _house_ project?
10. What happens when you invoke `fill()` method on your `Rectangle` instance?
11. Try `translate()` and `grow()` methods on `Rectangle` instances and observe the difference in behaviors. What is the difference?
12. Download and extract _pictures_ project in your **bluej_projects** folder. Open in BlueJ. Try different ways of creating `Picture` instances. Try calling various methods available and see how many methods you are able to use as expected.
