### Self Review

Today, we have covered a lot of new ground, and we have introduced a lot of new concepts.  
We will be building on these in future sessions, so it is important that you are comfortable with them. Try the following **pencil-and-paper exercises** as a way of checking that you are becoming used to the terminology that we have introduced today. Donâ€™t be put off by the fact that we suggest that you do these on paper rather than within BlueJ.  
_It will be good practice to try things out without a compiler._

1. What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one field called name, to a circle object?
2. Write the header for a method named `send` that has one parameter of type `String`, and does not return a value.
3. Write the header for a method named `average` that has two parameters, both of type `int`, and returns an `int` value.
4. *Method:* `reverseString`  
   *Details:* Write a method named `reverseString` that takes a String as a parameter and returns a new String with the characters in reverse order.  
   What's the method header for `reverseString`?
5. *Method:* `calculateBMI`  
   *Details:* Implement a method called `calculateBMI` that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height), where weight is in kilograms and height is in meters. The method should take two parameters: `weight` (int) and `height` (double), and return the BMI as a double.  
   What's the method header for `calculateBMI`?
6. **Scenario:** You're working on a student grading system. Create a method named `isPassing` to determine if a student has passed a course based on their score. The method should take one parameter: `score`, an integer representing the student's score. It should return true if the student has passed (score >= 60), and false otherwise.  
   What's the method header for `isPassing`?
7. **Scenario:** You are developing a simple calculator application. Implement a method called `isOperatorValid` to check if a given string represents a valid arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). The method should take one parameter: `operator`, a String representing the arithmetic operator. It should return true if the operator is valid, and false otherwise.  
   What's the method header for `isOperatorValid`?
8. **Scenario:** You are building a car rental system. Create a method named `generateRentalContract` to generate a rental contract for a customer. The method should take three parameters: `customerName`, a String representing the customer's name, `carModel`, a String representing the model of the rented car, and `rentalDays`, an integer representing the number of days the car is rented. It should return a String containing the rental contract details.
