### Let's Practice Methods More

Let's try writing the insides of these methods:

**String and Concatenation Methods:**  
1. Write a method header called `generatePassword` that takes a String parameter representing a username and returns a password by concatenating the username with a special character and a randomly generated number.
   Your method should meet at least the following test cases:  
   `generatePassword("john") --> "john@123"`  
   `generatePassword("jane") --> "jane#456"`  
   `generatePassword("alice") --> "alice$789"`  

2. Write a method header named `formatPhoneNumber` that takes three String parameters representing the area code, prefix, and line number of a phone number, and returns the formatted phone number by concatenating them with "-" in between.
   Your method should meet at least the following test cases:  
   `formatPhoneNumber("123", "456", "7890") --> "(123) 456-7890"`  
   `formatPhoneNumber("555", "123", "4567") --> "(555) 123-4567"`  
   `formatPhoneNumber("987", "654", "3210") --> "(987) 654-3210"`  

3. Write a method header named `createTitle` that takes two String parameters representing a title and a subtitle, and returns a formatted title by concatenating them with " - " in between.
   Your method should meet at least the following test cases:  
   `createTitle("Java Basics", "A Beginner's Guide") --> "Java Basics - A Beginner's Guide"`  
   `createTitle("Python Programming", "For Data Science") --> "Python Programming - For Data Science"`  
   `createTitle("Web Development", "Using HTML and CSS") --> "Web Development - Using HTML and CSS"`  

**Methods with int and double:**  
1. *Method:* `calculateAreaOfRectangle`  
   *Details:* Write a method named `calculateAreaOfRectangle` that takes two integers representing the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns the area of the rectangle.
2. *Method:* `calculateAverage`  
   *Details:* Write a method named `calculateAverage` that takes three integers as parameters and returns the average of the three numbers.
3. *Method:* `calculateSimpleInterest`  
   *Details:* Write a method named `calculateSimpleInterest` that takes three doubles representing the principal amount, rate of interest (in percentage), and time (in years) as parameters and returns the simple interest earned.
4. *Method:* `calculatePerimeterOfCircle`  
   *Details:* Create a method named `calculatePerimeterOfCircle` that takes a double representing the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns the perimeter of the circle.
5. *Method:* `calculateVolumeOfCylinder`  
   *Details:* Implement a method called `calculateVolumeOfCylinder` that takes two doubles representing the radius and height of a cylinder as parameters and returns the volume of the cylinder.
