### Figures Challenge

Choose any one of the following images or make your own:  
1. ![House](../../../../resources/practice/session_time/images/session01-challenge01.png)
2. ![Couple](../../../../resources/practice/session_time/images/session01-challenge02.png)

## House Challenges

1. Add a sunset to the single-sun version of `Picture`. That is, make the sun go down slowly. Remember: The circle has a method `slowMoveVertical` that you can use to do this.
2. If you added your sunset to the end of the `draw` method (so that the sun goes down automatically when the picture is drawn), change this now. We now want the sunset in a separate method, so that we can call `draw` and see the picture with the sun up, and then call `sunset` (a separate method!) to make the sun go down.
3. Make a person walk up to the house after the sunset.
