## Session 1
### Experimenting with Expressions in Code Pad

1. Try the following:  
   `sum = 99 + 3;`  
   Observe the error.  
   Now try the following:

   ```java
   int sum = 0;
   sum = 99 + 3;
   sum
   ```

   Now, try this:  
   `String swimmer = "cat" + "fish";`  
   `swimmer`  
   What would you expect to see after the following?  
   `String fish = swimmer;`  
   `fish`  
   Try it out. What do you think has happened in the assignment?

3. Open the Code Pad in the _better-ticket-machine_ project. Type the following in the Code Pad:

   ```java
   TicketMachine t1 = new TicketMachine(1000);
   t1.getBalance()
   t1.insertMoney(500);
   t1.getBalance()
   ```

   Take care to type these lines exactly as they appear here; pay particular attention to whether or not there is a semicolon at the end of the line. Note what the calls to `getBalance` return in each case.
4. Now add the following in the Code Pad:  
   `TicketMachine t2 = t1;`  
   What would you expect a call to `t2.getBalance()` to return? Try it out.
5. Add the following:  
    `t1.insertMoney(500);`
   What would you expect the following to return? Think carefully about this before you try it, and be sure to use the `t2` variable this time.  
   `t2.getBalance()`  
   Did you get the answer you expected? Can you find a connection between the variables `t1` and `t2` that would explain what is happening?

## Session 2
### The Clock display project intro

Demo first..  

**Download the project:**  
[Clock Display](../../../projects/bluej/part03/clock-display.zip)

### Let's Experiment
1. Think again about the lab-classes project that we discussed in the last two projects. Imagine that we create a LabClass object and three Student objects. We then enroll all three students in that lab. Try to draw a class diagram and an object diagram for that situation. Identify and explain the differences between them.
2. At what time(s) can a class diagram change? How is it changed?
3. At what time(s) can an object diagram change? How is it changed?
4. Write a definition of a field named tutor that can hold a refer-
ence to an object of type Instructor.
5. Open the number-display project. Select Show Terminal from the View menu and select Record method calls, as you did with the figures project. This will allow you to see the result of your interactions with objects, which will be useful when we look in detail at the full clock-display project. Now create a NumberDisplay object and give it the name hours, rather than using the default name offered by BlueJ. Use a rollover limit of 24. Open an inspector window for this object. With the inspector open, call the objectâ€™s increment method. Note what is shown in the Terminal window. Repeatedly call the increment method until the value in the inspector rolls over to zero. (If you are feeling impatient, you could always create a NumberDisplay object with a lower limit!)
6. Create a second NumberDisplay object with a limit of 60, and give it the name minutes. Call its increment method and note how the method calls are represented in the Terminal window. Imagine that the hours and minutes objects on the object bench represent the two NumberDisplay objects managed by a ClockDisplay object. In effect, you are now performing the role of the ClockDisplay object. What should you do each time you call increment on minutes to decide whether it has rolled over and whether increment should therefore be called on the hours
object?
7. Select Show Code Pad from the View menu. Create a NumberDisplay object with limit 6 in the Code Pad by typing  
`NumberDisplay nd = new NumberDisplay(6);`  
Then call its getValue, setValue, and increment methods in the Code Pad (e.g., by typing nd.getValue()). Note that statements (mutators) need a semicolon at the end, while expressions (accessors) do not. The call to setValue will need to include a numerical parameter value. Use the recorded method calls in the Terminal window to help you with the correct way of writing these method calls.
8. What error message do you see in the Code Pad if you type the following?  
`NumberDisplay.getValue()`  
Take a careful look at this error message and try to remember it because you will likely encounter something similar on numerous future occasions. Note that the reason for the error is that the class name, NumberDisplay, has been used incorrectly to try to call the getValue method, rather than the variable name `nd`.
9. What error message do you see in the Code Pad if you type the following?
`nd.setValue(int 5);`  
The error message is not actually very helpful at all. Can you work out what is incorrect about this call to setValue, and correct it? It would also be worth remembering this error message because it results from an easy error to make in
the early stages of learning.
