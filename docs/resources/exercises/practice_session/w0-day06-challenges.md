# Module 1: Java Foundations
## Day 5: Introduction to Java through BlueJ
### Work from Home

1. Similar to class work, take note of all properties of objects of other classes: `Square`, `Triangle`, and `Person`. And observe which methods of these objects are affecting which properties of these classes.
2. Refer to your 'house instructions' document from your Google Drive and repeat the same steps in BlueJ window and verify if your set of instructions are giving the same result as expected.

<!-- 2. Add a sunset to the single-sun version of `Picture`. That is, make the sun go down slowly. Remember: The circle has a method `slowMoveVertical` that you can use to do this.
3. If you added your sunset to the end of the `draw` method (so that the sun goes down automatically when the picture is drawn), change this now. We now want the sunset in a separate method, so that we can call `draw` and see the picture with the sun up, and then call `sunset` (a separate method!) to make the sun go down.
4. Make a person walk up to the house after the sunset. -->
